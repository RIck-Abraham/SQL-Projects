# Employees Filtered By Last Name Pattern Sorted By Employee Number

## Overview
This project hosts an SQL query designed to fetch detailed information from an employee database, focusing on employees whose last names start with 'Smith'. The goal is to provide an efficient and straightforward method for retrieving employee data, which can be particularly useful for HR departments and administrative tasks.

## Features
- **Targeted Query**: Retrieves employee details such as Employee Number, Last Name, First Name, and Middle Initial for those with last names beginning with 'Smith'.
- **Sorted Results**: Orders the output by Employee Number to facilitate easier analysis and processing.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Compatible with various SQL database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rick-Abraham/SQL-Projects/Employees-Filtered-By-Last-Name-Pattern-Sorted-By-Emp-Num.git


### Usage

To use the `getAcronym` function in your project, simply include it in your Python file. You can then generate an acronym by passing a phrase or name as an argument to the `getAcronym` function:

```python
phrase = "Your Input Phrase Here"
acronym = getAcronym(phrase)
print(f"The acronym is: {acronym}")
```

### Example

To test the function, you can run the `Acronyms.py` script and enter a phrase when prompted:

```bash
python Acronyms.py
```

Input:

```
Enter a phrase: Central Intelligence Agency
```

Output:

```
The acronym is: CIA
```
